# CSVToCSVW
Generates JSON-LD for various types CSVs

The script csv_parser.ipynb allows the user to
construct a parse-specification from their csv file.
The parse-specification is in the "CSV on the Web" format

(see https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/ for more information),

allowing access to many tools designed to use this specific interface.

The resulting parse-specification can then be used to extract information
out of the csv file.
